Navigate Around USC!

Have you ever been invited to an event, which says the venue is SGM 101, and you wondered where(and actually what) 
is this SGM? 

This app solves that problem. You can search for the buildings and parking structures using their abbreviations. 
Moreover, you are provided with a list of Buildings that you can go through in case you don't know the abbreviations 
and want to find a building.

In one of the future updates, the parking and their navigation was added too.
